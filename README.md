Peer-graded Assignment 1
This week, I will focus on my final assignment, which will be peer-graded, marking the culmination of the skills I've gained throughout the course. Throughout this course, I've been introduced to a variety of essential data science tools, and for my final project, I will apply them in a practical and hands-on way.

In this assignment, I will use **Jupyterlite Notebook**, a lightweight, user-friendly tool ideal for sharing my work publicly. Jupyterlite allows me to create interactive, shareable notebooks without needing to install anything on my computer, making it perfect for collaboration and dissemination of my findings.

Hosted on **Skills Network labs**, I will create my project in **Jupyterlite Notebook** and share it with my peers through a public **GitHub link**. This exercise will not only allow me to demonstrate my understanding of the course material but also help me practice the important skill of sharing and presenting data science work in a collaborative environment. By the end of this assignment, I will have a tangible portfolio piece that showcases my data science capabilities and my ability to communicate insights effectively.
